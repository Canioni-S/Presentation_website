                            <p>Before interesting myself into web development, I was a builder. I obtained my diploma at
                                the
                                French
                                formation center
                                "Les compagnons du devoir", one of the best of its kind. I worked for 10 years as a
                                builder
                                and
                                I developed a full range of skills that I am sure will be very useful in my new field of
                                work. I
                                worked
                                in different enterprises and in different countries with different types of
                                responsibilities.
                            </p>
                            <h3>These years of experience helped me develop the following skills:</h3>
                            <p>I can easily adapt my working methods.</p>
                            <p>I know how to structure my work and solve the problems encountered.</p>
                            <p>I am familiar with working with a deadline and how to manage my time.</p>
                            <p>I don't quit because "it's hard"</p>

                            <h3>new zealand</h3>
                            <p>In 2015, I decided to go to New Zealand with a friend on a one year working holiday visa.
                                During this journey I meet my wife and We traveled around the country doing Woofing
                                (Work for travel),
                                getting to know the culture, the English language and new people.</p>

                            <p>
                                I spent the two following years in my wife's homeland, Chile. These new experience
                                allowed me to grow professionaly by learning new wood working methods. Once more, I got
                                to know new people, their culture and their own approach to life
